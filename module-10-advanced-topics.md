### Module 10: Advanced Topics

Module 10 delves into several advanced topics in web development. These topics go beyond the fundamentals and cover areas that are highly relevant in modern web development. Let's explore these sub-modules in detail:

#### 10.1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Node.js

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where web pages are initially rendered on the server and then sent to the client. This approach enhances web application performance, SEO, and user experience. In this module, you'll learn about SSR and how to implement it using Node.js.

**Key Concepts:**
- Rendering web pages on the server.
- Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js.
- SEO benefits.
- Performance improvements.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Server-side rendering with Node.js
const express = require('express');
const reactApp = require('./your-react-app');

const app = express();

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const content = reactApp.renderToString();
  const html = `<html><body>${content}</body></html>`;
  res.send(html);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### 10.2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that provide a native app-like experience on the web. PWAs combine the best of web and mobile apps, including offline capabilities, push notifications, and fast loading. In this module, you'll explore PWA concepts and how to build them.

**Key Concepts:**
- Service workers for offline support.
- Web app manifest.
- Caching strategies.
- Responsive design.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Adding a service worker for offline support
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(reg => console.log('Service Worker registered', reg))
    .catch(err => console.error('Service Worker registration failed', err));
}
```

#### 10.3. Frameworks and Libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)

Frameworks and libraries are crucial in modern web development. This module covers popular web development frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. You'll learn how to use these frameworks to build interactive and feature-rich web applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- React, Vue, and Angular fundamentals.
- Component-based architecture.
- State management.
- Routing and navigation.
- HTTP requests.

**Example:**
```javascript
// React component example
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, {this.props.name}!</div>;
  }
}
```

#### 10.4. Browser DevTools and Extensions

Understanding and utilizing browser developer tools is essential for efficient web development. This module covers browser DevTools and extensions, helping you become proficient in debugging, profiling, and optimizing web applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- Browser DevTools features.
- Debugging JavaScript.
- Network monitoring.
- Performance profiling.
- Browser extensions for development.

**Example:**
- Using Chrome DevTools to inspect and modify the DOM.
- Profiling JavaScript performance to identify bottlenecks.

#### 10.5. Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are architectural approaches that involve dividing an application into smaller, loosely coupled services. This module explores these concepts and how they impact modern web development.

**Key Concepts:**
- Microservices architecture.
- Communication between microservices.
- Containerization with Docker.
- Orchestration with Kubernetes.
- API gateways.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Microservice in Node.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Microservice A');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Microservice A is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

These advanced topics provide a comprehensive understanding of modern web development. Whether you're interested in enhancing web application performance, building with popular frameworks, optimizing for SEO, or diving into microservices, this module covers it all.
